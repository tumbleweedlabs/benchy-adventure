Benchy Adventure that let's you turn them into a fun adventure at sea! Each player uses a Benchy as their game piece and calibration cubes are [rolled as dice](https://github.com/tumbleweedlabs/benchy-adventure/wiki/Dice-Mechanics).

### Designer Templates
Weâ€™ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.

### Creating pages manually
If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.
