# Summary

The perfect Accessory to go with everyone's favorite little Tug Boat, The Benchy Barge!
I have made 2 versions of the Benchy Barge. 
- The Basic version is just that a empty barge. 
- The Extras version is a customizable version with accessories that connect using a Lego style quick connect.

The accessories I've made so far include a Construction Crane, Grain Transport, Stone Transport, and Fuel Transport.

I also included basic versions of the crane parts, which are less detailed and easier to print.

- update 22 January 2018
I added the MK2 crane that's bigger and can rotate
