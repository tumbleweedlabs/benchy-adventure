# Summary

I designed a simple dock awhile ago for my Benchy prints to rest at, however, as I got more filaments and Benchies, I realized my original dock simply wasn't big enough. Thus I made a bigger dock, which has plenty of room for many more Benchy prints.

This larger dock is multiple of my smaller docks combined: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1800437. 

The Benchy models that are featured in the picture are from: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:763622
